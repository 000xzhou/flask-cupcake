# flask-cupcake

## questions

- why are we using models? Since forms/js post the data out side of models range?

## todo

- Add tests to make sure that the GET/PATCH/DELETE routes return a 404 when the cupcake cannot be found.
- Add functionality for searching for cupcakes where you can type in a search term, submit to the backend and see a newly filtered list of cupcakes.
- Refactor your front-end code to be object-oriented using class methods -SKIP for now
- Enhance your search functionality so that you do not need to wait to submit to filter by flavors.
- When you add or edit a cupcake, you can identify what ingredients you need for that cupcake. You should also have a page where you can add or edit ingredients.
